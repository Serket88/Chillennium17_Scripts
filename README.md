# Revival Survival scripts

These are the scripts that I wrote during the Chillenium 2017 game-jam for our game, Revival Survival.  This repository isn't meant to hold a complete game, but rather hold an example of the Unity coding experience I've gained and the amount I can write in a short amount of time.  All scripts are in C#.

If you would like to see the game in action, I have hosted it on my website at http://www.caleb-perkins.com/index.php/revival-survival/
